## Project Summary

For our final project, we are developing a synthetic politician. To do this, we are creating a text generator; taking
speeches from previous American presidents to create a new one. Then, we are going to attempt to do some voice synthesis
to read the speech.

## Project Implementation Details

To run the speech generator:

1. Make sure that python is installed on your system. To check this, run the following command: `python --version`. Otherwise, check the [documentation website](https://www.python.org) to find instructions on how to install python on your system.
2. Next, you need to clone the repository from GitHub. You can do this by opening your command line interface, navigating to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and typing `git clone git@github.com:CMPSC-310-AI-Spring2023/project-Burnytoast.git`
3. Then, you need to install the `openai` package with the following command: `pip install openai`.
4. After installing the `openai` package, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository. Then, you need to navigate to the `src` directory and open the `text_generator.py` file. Edit the line of code with the comment `Add OpenAI API Key` to contain your OpenAI API key within the `''`.
5. Finally, run the `text_generator.py` file by running the following command: `python3[/python/py] text_generator.py`

## Ethical Implications

Using text generation technology to impersonate politicians and spread false information can be highly unethical and damaging to individuals and society. It is important to approach the use of this technology with caution and to make sure we understand the potential consequences before using it

## Team Working Strategy (if worked in a team)

Our team worked together on all aspects of the project. We searched for speeches to use in training, collaborated on coding tasks, and solved problems together.
