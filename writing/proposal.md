# Project Proposal

## TODO: Andrew Briercheck, Miles Franck, Nic Ingerson

## Proposed Application

We are proposing developing an AI that would a viable political candidate. We will be implimenting and improving code from the movie generation project, but using that to generate a viable set of ideals for out "candidate" and will output those responses in a short speech. We will then use snipits of these ideas to generate a "portrait" of our politician using stable diffusion and we will have him "deliver" his speech, using eleven labs
